#### Dropdown

- **Header** - Fixed issue where using `image icon` or `image outline icon` would cause incorrect display within `ui header` due to namespace collision with `ui image` [#4145](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/pull/4145)
- **Visibility** - Images that use `$('img').visibility({ type: 'image'})` will no longer animate a second time if re-initialized.

### Version 2.2.3 - August 21, 2016

- **Dropdown** - Using `search selection with `selectOnKeydown` and text content that includes html, will not apply html content (like images) to the text until dropdown blur, making sure that content can align correctly with the partial search content of the search input (which cannot include HTML)

### Version 2.2.0 - June 26, 2016

- **Visibility** - Added `onLoad` and `onAllLoaded` callback for `type: 'image'` visibility
- **Image** - `transition hidden image` now shows correctly as `visibility: hidden;` and not `display: none`. This will allow `offset` with `visibility` and `sticky` to work more seamlessly. `hidden image` will still remain `display: none;`
- **Button** - Added variables for configuring `disabled` background image and box shadow.

### Version 2.0.6 - July 22, 2015

- **List**- Fixed issue where using an image variation like `ui image label` as a direct child of an `item` would remove right padding [#2691](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2691)

### Version 2.0.1 - July 6, 2015

- **Image** - Fixed `mini image` having wrong pixel size in docs [#2521](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2521)
- **Image** - Added docs for missing `fluid image` variation

### Version 2.0.0 - June 30, 2015

- **Modal** - If you are using a modal with image content, you will need to use `image content` on the parent element. This is because `flex` rules require parent styling that the previous `table-row` rules did not.
- **Card** - Cards now support multiple custom `content` blocks. Content blocks and images can now appear in any order.
- **Image** - Images now include a `spaced` variation for adding whitespace around images when used inline with text.
- **Label** - Label now sets an `img` height even when not using an `image label`
- **Menu** - Horizontal menus now set a default image size for images / logos
- **Modal** - Modal content now uses flex, image content now requires `image content` class on parent to allow for flex stylings.
- **Visibility/Sticky** - Visibility and sticky now refresh automatically after page content loading to deal with changes in position from images loading
- **Visibility** - Visibility `image` will now wait to lazy load images that are *above* the current screen position, not just below.
- **Image** - `rounded image` and `circular image` now apply border radius to all child elements, fixing dimmers, and other content rounding
- **Image** - `avatar image` size has been slightly decreased
- **Image** - `mini image` default width has been increased to `35px`

### Version 1.12.0 - April 13, 2015

- **Visibility** - Adds updated visibility module from `2.x` channel. Visibility will automatically refresh by default after images load on page refresh. Fixes issues with element positions after image loading.
- **Visibility** - Fixed issue where `precache` behavior was missing from visibility causing `image` lazy loading to fail

### Version 1.11.0 - March 3, 2015

- **Visibility** - Attach callbacks to elements visibility conditions like `top visible` `bottom visible`, `passing`. Useful for things like: image lazy loading, infinite scroll content, and recording tracking metrics.

### Version 1.10.0 - February 23, 2015

- **Image* - Added `hidden image` state

### Version 1.9.2 - February 19, 2015

- **Modal** - Fixes typo causing `middle aligned` image not to work correctly.

### UI Changes

- **Label** - `ribbon label` can now be used inside `ui image` and `ui card` correctly
- **Card** - `image` inside `content` no longer has a fixed size **Thanks @romuloctba**

### Version 1.5.0 - December 30, 2014

- **Table** - Table now has coupling with image to make sure size is preserved correctly with table sizing when used inside a table cell.

### Version 1.3.0 - December 17, 2014

- **Image** - UI image now works with SVG

### Version 1.1.0 - December 02, 2014
